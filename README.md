# node-word-gen
This project uses node.js to take user input, add it to a file, and then pick a random word. The possibilities for words is endless, as long as you have the file space. 

### Dependencies 
To use this project you have to have the latest version of node.js installed on your computer, as well has the `prompt-sync` npm package. This is the only dependancy this project has. To install the package, run `npm install prompt-sync` in a command line.

The program also requires a txt document named `test.txt` in the same directory where index.js is saved. In future updates, it will create it's own file if one isn't present, but as of right now it requires you have `test.txt` in the same directory. 
### Running
To run this program, open a cmd / powershell / terminal in the directory where both index.js and test.txt are saved. Type `node index.js` and click enter, and then it should run. In the future it will be made into an executable, but as of right now this isn't a top priority.
